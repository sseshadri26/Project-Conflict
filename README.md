# Project-Conflict
 
Introducing Food Fight! A 2 player co-op game where conflict is key! This project was made as a part of ACM Studio's Student Run Studios.


## Synopsis

Is a hotdog a sandwich? Is cereal soup? Is water wet? Does pineapple go on pizza? Dive into the world of pointless conflict in Food Fight! Pick a side, argue with your friends, then battle it out to defeat the most enemies to be able to determine who is right! Work together - or don't! Petty conflict will take you all the way to victory.
